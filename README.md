# PyQt Collapsable Widget
*A PyQt collapsable widget in the spirit of the Maya ***frameLayout*** command*

## Why ?
Because if there is no widget collapsable in PyQt (until Qt5). But the Maya cmds has a UI command called **frameLayout** that makes its content collapsable. Inside a PyQt design, for consistency, I made this code to create a collapsable widget. With the help from [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/python_inside_maya/vO1pvA4YhF0/WpXMlkpgl54J), especially [this chunk](http://pastebin.com/qYgDDYsB).

## How does it look?
**Here you can see the result in a standard Python application**
